  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        Add core_courseformat\base::invalidate_all_session_caches to reset course editor cache for all users when course is changed.
        This method can be used as an alternative to core_courseformat\base::session_cache_reset for resetting the cache for the current user 
        in case the change in the course should be reflected for all users.
      type: improved
