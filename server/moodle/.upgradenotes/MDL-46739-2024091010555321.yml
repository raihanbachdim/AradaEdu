issueNumber: MDL-46739
notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        The {user_preferences}.value database field is now TEXT instead of CHAR.
        This means that any queries with a condition on this field in a WHERE or
        JOIN statement will need updating to use `$DB->sql_compare_text()`. See
        the `$newusers` query in
        `\core\task\send_new_users_password_task::execute` for an example.
